''''''''''' what is React Hooks ? ''''''''''

--- Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allows you to use React features without having to write a class.
    eg: - state of a component

    Hooks don't work inside classes

"""""""""  Why Hooks ? ''''''''''''''

Reason set 1 : -
````````````

--- understand how this keyword works in javascript.
    remember to bind event handlers in class components.
    Classes don't modify verywell and make hot reloading very unreliable.

----Above mentioned way are used in class components. since we are not going to work with classes we are not going to face this problems. 

Reason set 2 :-
`````````````

There is no particular way to reuse statefull component logic.
since we have HOC and Render props patterns do address this problem make the code harder to follow.
there is need a to share statefull logic in a better way.

--- Hooks help us to reuse statefull logic without changing our hierarcy

Reason set 3 : -
`````````````

Create componets for complex scenarios such as data fetching and subscribing to event related code is not organized in one place.

ex: - Data fetching -> In componentDidMount  and componentDidUpdate
      EventListenrs -> In componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount

      Because of statefull logic cannot break components into smaller ones.

Hooks let you split into one componet into smaller function based on what peaces are related.


NET WORTHY   points: -
````````````````````

React version 16.8 or higher, completely opt in.

Hooks don't contain any breaking changes in the release is 100% backwards- compatible.

Classes won't be removed from React.

Can't use hooks inside of a class components.

Hook's don't replace your existing knowledge of react concept.

Instead Hooks provide a more direct API to the react components you already know.


Rules of HOOKS : - 
````````````````

"Only call hooks at the top level".
Don't call hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested function.

"Only call hooks from React Functions".
Call them from within React functional components and not just any regular javascript function.
